# EcomDemo

The E-Commerce App is an Android application developed in Kotlin using Android Studio. The app caters to two roles: User and Seller. 

The Seller role allows sellers to add new products with details such as Product Name, Price, Category, and Description. The product information is stored in a local Room Database. Sellers are required to Sign Up and Log In before adding any new products. They can also view a list of all the previously added products by them.

The User role requires users to Sign Up and Log In with their mobile number to access the home page. The home page displays a list of all the products added by different Sellers. Users can view individual product pages and add products to their cart. The cart page calculates the total cart price from all the added products by the user. The project is developed using Jetpack Compose, a modern UI toolkit for building Android apps.
